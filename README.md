# tsp

An approximation algorithm for the TSP optimization problem. Based on a project by Elliot Bates, Matthew Meyn and Marco Zamora. I have tested this project with python 3.4.3. It makes use of Andrew Harrington's modification of the well-known John Zelle graphics library.

tsp.py is a python 3 script that should be given one argument: the name of the problem file, which should be located in the directory problems/ and should contain a list in the form 

{ id number }   { x coord }   { y coord }
