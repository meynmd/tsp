# tsp

An approximation algorithm for the TSP optimization problem.

tsp.py is a python 3 script that should be given one argument: the name of the problem file, which should be located in the directory problems/ and should contain a list in the form 

{ id number }   { x coord }   { y coord }

The solution is written to { problem filename }.tour and is also represented in a graphics window.
